Exclusive or (XOR):

       10101011 
    ^  11011110
    ___________
       01110101
   
    Returns 1 if the two bits are different.

Shifts:

    bit >> x 
    Division of bit by (2^x)

    bit << x
    Multiplication of bit with (2^x)

    Bit shifts can be used on a single bit.

    
Switch and toggle:

    bit |= x
    Switches on the bit at position (2^x)

    bit ^= x
    Toggles the bit at position (2^x)

    Difference between "Switching on" and toggling:

    Switching on means turning it to 1. If already 1 it stays 1.

    Toggling it means switching it to the opposite.

    if      0   |  if      1
    toggle  1   |  toggle  0
