#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h> /* Standard boolean library for c */

bool b = true
/* method of defining the variable */

Boolean operators in c:

&&  AND
||  OR
!   NOT

operators without using the libraty:

a = 0 /* This is taken as flase */
b = 69 /* This is taken as true */
using any of the above operators solves the equation as a boolean operation

a = !a /* a is now set as true */
logical operators will replace the values as either 0 or 1.
